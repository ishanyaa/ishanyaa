Hey there! I'm Ishanya—just a senior trying to keep my circuits from shorting out while majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.

I love exploring anything and everything—except for my inbox… that’s a scary place XD

Always open to collaboration! If you’ve got a cool project, hit me up—unless it involves debugging at 3 AM, then we might need to renegotiate XD
