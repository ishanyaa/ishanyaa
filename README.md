Hey there! I'm Ishanya, majoring in EECS-Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. I love blending Theory ML, Edge AI, and Privacy to create cool innovations and exploring anything and everything, except for my inbox… that’s a scary place XD

Always open to collaboration! If you’ve got a cool project, hit me up!
